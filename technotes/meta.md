# Technical Notes for UDMOEA

2017-02-14 09:26

## Purpose of Technical Notes

Each Technical Note covers a small, focused aspect of the
MOEA design.

## Naming

Until we've chosen a name for the new MOEA, these notes
will refer to it as UDMOEA, where UD stands for "Under
Development."  This should be easy to search-and-replace
later, once a proper name is chosen.
