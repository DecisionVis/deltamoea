# Motivation

2017-02-14 13:29

The principal motivation in the design of UDMOEA is to make
multiobjective optimization an easy to use tool for exploring
a design problem.

## Associated Project Goals

* Conserve model evaluations.  Computational models can
  be expensive.
* Support exploratory use of UDMOEA by making it easy to
  redefine objectives while reusing previous evaluations.
* Make it as easy as possible to work with existing computational
  models.
* Support concurrent evaluation without imposing a mechanism.
* Clearly document how to use UDMOEA.
* Provide working examples that complement the documentation.
